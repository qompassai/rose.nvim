# How to stay updated

To get updates once this on your computer, you have two options:

1. [**Using HTTPS (Most Common)**](#using-https-most-common)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/qompassai/Equator.git

git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

2. **Using SSH(Advanced)**:

-  MacOS | Linux | Microsoft WSL **with** [GitHub CLI (gh)](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

```bash
gh repo clone qompassai/Equator
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qompassai/Equator.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

    * are not new to Github
    * You want to add a new technical skill

- MacOS | Linux | Microsoft WSL

- Option 1:
**This will **overwrite** any local changes you've made**

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

-Option 2:
**To keep your local changes and still get the updates**

```bash
git stash
